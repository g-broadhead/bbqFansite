      American BBQ.....<br><br>
      The name alone conjures up images of hours of slow cooking over low heat; smoke from wood flavouring the meat. Low and slow they call it. The only form of cooking that awakens man’s primitive senses. <br>
      The scent of this form of BBQ can be picked up a far way off, causing us to hunt down the cook off. Once found, a feast of pure bliss occurs and food coma is around the corner. <br><br>
      In the United States, barbecue refers to a technique of cooking meat outdoors over a fire; often this is called
      pit barbecue, and the facility for cooking it is the barbecue pit. <br>
      This form of cooking adds a distinctive smoky taste to the meat; barbecue sauce, while a common accompaniment, is not required for many styles. <br>
      Often the proprietors of Southern-style barbecue establishments in other areas originate from the South. In the South,barbecue is more than just a style of cooking, but a subculture with wide variation between regions, and fierce rivalry for titles at barbecue competitions.

      <p class="center">
        Barbecue is a big deal in the Carolinas, and it’s easy to understand why—many food scholars pinpoint North
        Carolina as the likely birthplace of barbecue in the U.S.<br>
        If you happen to be passing through the Carolinas and you get a hankering for barbecue, your precise location will
        provide a major clue about what you’re likely to get at a given stop.

      They say everything is bigger in Texas. That’s definitely the case where barbecue is concerned.<br>
      In fact, Texas barbecue is such an institution that there are at least four distinct styles that enjoy widespread
      popularity. Each of these styles saw its origins and evolution in a different <br>
      section of the Lone Star State, but one thing they all have in common that makes them Texan through-and-through is their preference for hearty cuts of beef.

      <h2 class="headerAdjust">Kansas City</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="center">
        The people of Kansas City are true-blue barbecue aficionados.<br>
        This is evident from the sheer variety of meats they’re eager to give the slow-smoked treatment to: <br>
        staples like pork,beef, and chicken, of course,but also sausage, turkey, lamb, and even fish. And don’t forget the burnt ends—any KansasCitian will tell you they’re the best part of the whole brisket.<br>
      
        Another thing that makes Kansas City barbecue special is its signature sauce. The thick tomato-based mixture provides a harmonious balance of sweetness and spice and is best applied in copious quantities.
